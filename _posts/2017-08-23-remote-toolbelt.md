Being a remote developer isn't an easy task and as such having tools to make things going as smooth as possible is a must.

Deciding which tools can be time consuming so instead of rushing to find them by yourselves I'd like to leave here this list from [Laila](http://www.remotestarterkit.com/?ref=producthunt) and a review for some of them from myself.

#Slack

Best features:

* It has a multitude of possible integrations and also accept custom webhooks.
* Beyond chat it can do calls, yet without the conference benefit so is 1 to 1 only, still is better than nothing.
* You can participate of multiple organizations
* iOS/Android/Desktop/Web apps for free!

Downside:

* After a given number of messages you start to loose history, except if you have payed for the service
* File limit, which is removed/increased once you have payed
* No "hangouts" with multiple users unless payed

#Trello

Best features:

* Simple drag n' drop board that servers as Kanban, Scrum or any other task board
* Multiple users with organization groups
* Easily archive and recover tasks
* Online, no installation
* Totally free!

Downside:

* There is no integration with other tools
* Web only, no internet no app
* No calendar or gantt or any other management control

#Toogl

Best features:

* Free
* Reports with total hours spent and break down by tasks and time periods
* Projects and tasks control
* Send email you when task is forgot running

Downside:

* Have to type tasks
*

#Google Drive

Best features:

* Free up to a given size
* Share with anyone using gmail
* Good enough replacement for Microsoft Office

Downside:

* The folder organization in really confusing
* The sharing system is also bad
*
