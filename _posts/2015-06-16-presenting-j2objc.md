From time to time adding new options to back your solutions and ideas is a good practice and also can be refreshing.

Building apps for multiple platforms with great quality and user experience is a hard work, and most of the times we dump traditional solutions like PhoneGap in their favor.

Is not like if those tools don't work, but building hybrid applications is a dangerous field and there is a time and place for everything.

> User the right tools for the job.

Between so many options the open source world brings to us there is this one from Google that stands out. To make things more productive when building Inbox app for iOS from Java's source[^1] they developed a code translation tool.

To the rescue comes j2ObjC[^2] and with it new responsibilites and possibilites. It's focus is not on UI, is on logic only, which is great!

We are able to build a clever logic library in Java and test proof it on Android and also translate with a handful of scripts finally using the result on iOS project.

At first seems troublesome
