As a person that like to expand my knowledge I look for different areas which can bring more into my life and job.

To your surprise, or not, I like studying design and UX, they are both fun and useful in software development and for some of you the subject we are going to quickly initiate here is around some time by now: **Material Design**[^1].

Material Design is Google take on a visual language to elevate design to a new level.

> "Goal - Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science." Google


Was there problems with the way we did design before? I really don't think so, yet we can benefit from innovation on the current status quo.

I'm not a designer, neither a wanna be, but is important to us to understand our surroundings in technology to create better products.

Being that said here is a video from Google talking about what is Material Design.
