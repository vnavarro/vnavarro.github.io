Also one could check [ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](http://www.acm.org/about/se-code), I didn't read it fully yet but my guidance is to not stay put in face of challenges/problems and to improve yourself not only as a professional but also as a person.

Here also some books to help one in the hard journey to come:
