This one will be blazing fast read, at least here. Instead of going all verbose on what I did lets link the places where I got the information from on how to use **[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**.

**You gonna need to:**

1 - go wild with [disqus instructions page](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions) and [registration](https://disqus.com/home/explore/)

2 - the previous one probably won't do so follow perfectly random [post](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/adding-disqus-to-your-jekyll-powered-github-pages/)

3 - then if you get a little lost go to joshualande [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)

4 - by now everything should work just fine

**Don't forget to:**

1 - register at Disqus, I know it sounds dumb to repeat this...

2 - add the comment scripts right after your post content

3 - change Disqus configuration variables (script)

4 - comment out or remove `var disqus_developer = 1;`, this is for test purposes only

5 - pay attention to comments count tricks they give you, in case you want to display the number elsewhere


Know you just have to get ready for the comments rain!
