      <p>
        I'm a Computer Scientist graduated from Centro Universit√°rio Senac with a graduation course in Games: Production and Development also from Senac.
      </br>
      My career in software development started because of my desired of making digital games, since then I've created: desktop; web; mobile and game software, I've learned lots of things and I've met lots of good and not so good people. The outcome is that I really like every aspect of working in tech industry.
    </br>
    Furthermore I consider myself a generalist programmer but currently the languages most used are: Objective-C, Lua and Ruby.
  </br>
  And hey, these are things I deeply enjoy: technology, coding, teaching, video games, books, psychology, drawing and party with friends.

        Navarro is a serious professional, committed, with a great capacity for abstraction and concentration. He has a quick learning curve which allows him to act as a pivot in the teams of which he is part.
        He holds an unique style, always willing to help his teammates.
      </br>
        Furthermore, as a computer scientist he shows a taste for research on issues related to game development and game psychology.
</br>
        Certainly a very promising professional whom I highly recommend it.

        Vitor was a very diligent student, I was his teacher in object oriented programming discipline during 3rd semester of college. I emphasize that he presented fairly rapid evolution during the course, he surely is engaged and has a great ability to learn and adapt to new technologies. I also remember he had great relationship skills with both their colleagues and teachers.
