      <p>
        I'm a Computer Scientist graduated from Centro Universit√°rio Senac with a graduation course in Games: Production and Development also from Senac.
      </br>
      My career in software development started because of my desired of making digital games, since then I've created: desktop; web; mobile and game software, I've learned lots of things and I've met lots of good and not so good people. The outcome is that I really like every aspect of working in tech industry.
    </br>
    Furthermore I consider myself a generalist programmer but currently the languages most used are: Objective-C, Lua and Ruby.
  </br>
  And hey, these are things I deeply enjoy: technology, coding, teaching, video games, books, psychology, drawing and party with friends.
