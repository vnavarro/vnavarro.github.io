From time to time friends keep asking me the same question: Which is the best project management tool you know?  
First of all there is no such a thing as the best tool ever to solve a given problem, there are tools and there are problems and we should stick with the stack that solves them.  
That said I'd like to share some tools I use or would use.  

> Remember: they are ordered randomly  

###1. Basecamp

This web app is one of the most famous and works pretty well, you have:


* communication through messages
* projects
* file storage
* to-do
* calendar
* a progress timeline which shows everything that happened in a fashion manner

There is no gantt chart and also lacks something like campfire (slack or whatever you please). Still it is indeed a good tool, moreover it is not free, subscription starts at $20/month. [(They are giving a trial of 2 months)](https://basecamp.com)

###2. Bitrix24

Basecamp's competitor which has a subscription free layer. Sincerely I never used this one but has a plethora of features, like gantt charts, chat, video chat, HR management and even basecamp migration tool.

Ok the payed layer starts at pricey $99/month yet it costs nothing to pay a [visit](http://www.bitrix24.com/).

###3. Trello

Do you ever wish a good digital post-it board? Trello is excellent at that. It has:


* Infinite boards
* In-card file attachement
* Organizations
* Notifications, both Web and Desktop
* Card watch
* Card archive
* Board privacy
* Collaborattion
* Mobile app (plenty of versions)

It's just a simple board tool, but you don't have to pay and if you are like me, I prefer simple and directed tools over feature crowded ones, [Trello](https://trello.com/) is for you.

###4. Zoho Projects

I hear from Zoho by a long time now, yet I never took a chance on their product suite. Zoho Projects seems to be a good solution for project management and has a free subscription layer so you can test it before paying.  


* Gantt charts
* Timesheet
* Milestones and tasks
* Messages
* Bug tracking
* Reporting tools
* Google Apps integration
* Mobile app for iOS only

Give it a try [here](https://www.zoho.com/projects).

###5. HuBoard

This mention is special. As much as I love Trello there is only one thing I desired It had: GitHub integration.

Guess what? [HuBoard](https://huboard.com) = Trello + GitHub.

Furthermore it has other integrations possibilities like Slack and HipChat.

The down side: $7/month for users or $24/month for companies. Good things are not always free right? And it's really cheap.

Kudos to my friend [Serradura](https://github.com/serradura) which presented me this one.

### What else?

The internet is the house for a myriad of services and tools, payed and free, you just have to know what you're really looking for.  
I'll leave some finals mentions here I think worth checking:


* [Freedcamp](https://freedcamp.com/)
* [Asana](https://app.asana.com/)
* [Podio](https://podio.com/)

Also two blog posts I crossed by during my spare time:


* [Capterra](http://blog.capterra.com/free-open-source-project-management-software/)
* [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/business/14/1/top-project-management-tools-2014)
